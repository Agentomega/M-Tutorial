|   HALT

The HALT command is used to log off the system when youâ€™re done working with the M interpreter.

| Simply type HALT and hit <enter>.

Logging off any other way, such as unplugging the computer or leaving the terminal without doing anything, will not signal to the system that you are done. Not using the HALT function to exit can result in serious consequences later on.
