Hello World Example
===================

Description
###########
  This page provides a minimal example of M code.


Examples
########

::

   LABEL1 ; This is a label
    WRITE "Hello World !",!
    QUIT

Spaces are important in M.

The first line contains a label, and it is the only one that has a character in the first column.

The second line starts in the second column, and that indicates that WRITE is
to be interpreted as a command and not as a label.
